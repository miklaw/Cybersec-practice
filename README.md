# Cybersec-practice
Please read the Wiki for setup instructions.

The scripts in this repository have been created for educational purposes so that you can quickly set up a random environment to test your skills at making a computer more secure. This is designed to help you practice on your own time for cyber security competitions such as Cyberpatriot.

These scripts will set random requirements and give you a readme with information that you will use to identify what needs to be completed to make the computer more secure.

The instructions provided to create and configure Virtual Machines are written with VMware Workstation in mind, but the scripts should work on any hypervisor.

CAUTION!!!! These scripts are not designed to be run on physical hardware because they can install malware, tracking software, and change security settings that would open vectors of attack. If you accidentally run a script that could harm your computer, you will get a confirmation warning before continuing, but you can install it on a physical machine if you choose to do so.
